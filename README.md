# flightTest

# Model and controller have been implemented with no view whatsoever. That's the reason because Main method is dummy, doing nothing.
# Project scope covers till Unit Test, developed using JUnit; every not trivial and returning method of the controller and covers all the main ways of the code. 

# DB for getting flights, airplanes and airlines has been mocked being hardcoded into the code. These are the only comments in my solution, letting the reviewer know what it has to be replaced.
# As required, I have used Maven as automation tool, pushed here in my github account and link it to Travis CI for executing tests.
